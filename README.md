# Ecosystem-Simulation

This was my Computer Science A Level NEA.
I created a 200m*200m map featuring multiple biomes, terrain types and water features in a procedurally generated low poly map using:
- Poisson Disk sampling
- Delaunay Triangulation
- Perlin noise
- Floodfill algorithms

Multiple species of animals are then spawned in and populate the map. The animals are all capable of:
- Eating
- Drinking
- Hunting
- Avoiding predators
- Reproducing

Data is saved along the course of the simulation and can be viewed at the end in a graph viewer or exported to a .csv file
